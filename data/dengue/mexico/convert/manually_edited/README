1985.pdf is a bad PDF in that the column separator line for the row names cuts off Baja California Sur and any other names that are too long.

2003.pdf there are two Baja Californias. I'm assuming that the 2nd one is supposed to be Baja California Sur.

2006.pdf the ’99’ and ‘216’ both went into May as ’99 216’ for the Guerrero row. I’m not sure why since the column boundaries from locate_column_coordinates.py seem alright from the debug images.

2008.pdf they decided to use commas for decimal points in floating point numbers. Changed to period.
