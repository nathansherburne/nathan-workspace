"CME Scoreboard Login CME ScoreboardCME arrival time predictions from the research community:The CME scoreboard is part of the the CME Arrival Time  Impact Working Team in the Community-wide International Forum for Space Weather Modeling Capabilities Assessment.The CME Scoreboard (developed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, CCMC) is a research-based forecasting methods validation activity which provides a central location for the community to:submit their forecast in real-timequickly view all forecasts at once in real-timecompare forecasting methods when the event has arrivedUsing this system:Anyone can view prediction tablesUsers can enter in your CME shock arrival time forecast after logging in: Registered Users: Begin by finding your CME under the ""Active CMEs"" section, then click ""Add Prediction"" and select your forecasting ""Method Type"" from the list. (Click here to register for an account.)Power Users: If you do not see your CME listed under the ""Active CMEs"" section, click ""Add CME"" to get started (Click here to request power user privileges). To enter the actual CME shock arrival time, click ""Edit CME"" after you are done entering your prediction(s). Click here to see a list of registered methods. If you would like to register your prediction method, please send an email to M. Leila Mays or Yihua Zheng with your model/technique details. Click here for more detailed instructions.

"Insert title hereCCMC Rules of the Road: CCMC requests that users notify the CCMC, CME model/technique developers and submitting forecasters/researchers before performing event and validation studies with data from the CME Arrival Time Scoreboard. It is recommended that such studies be performed with the knowledge and collaboration of developers and submitting forecasters/researchers.Important Disclaimer NoticeIf you are looking for the official U.S. Government forecast for space weather, please go to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (http://swpc.noaa.gov).
