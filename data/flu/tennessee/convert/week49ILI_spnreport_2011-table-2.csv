Note:  Because of recent cases of illness with
a triple‚Äêreassortant swine origin influenza
"(trH3N2) in a small number of children"
"without swine contact in 2 states, the CDC"
has asked states to test more specimens from
"patients with ILI, especially children."
SP sites in TN may submit up to 10 viral
specimens / week from patients with ILI.
Specimens are essential for surveillance.
Contact your regional coordinator if you need
assistance.
